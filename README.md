# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-PCA-and-SVM
Project Overview üîé

This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction in a real-world medical classification task. The primary goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a number of clinical features.

We build and evaluate two models: a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using all available features, and a second SVM model trained on a reduced set of principal components derived from PCA. The project showcases how PCA can simplify a model by reducing its complexity while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

Dataset üìä

The project utilizes the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset, a well-known benchmark for classification tasks in the medical domain.

    Source: Heart Disease UCI on Kaggle

    File Used: heart_disease_uci.csv

    Description: The dataset contains 13 clinical features for each patient, such as age, blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol (chol), and maximum heart rate (thalach). The target variable indicates the presence of heart disease.

Project Workflow ‚öôÔ∏è

The project follows a structured methodology to preprocess the data, apply PCA, and compare model performance.

    Data Loading and Preprocessing:

        The dataset is loaded, explicitly treating the ? character as a missing value (NaN).

        Missing numerical values are imputed using the median of their respective columns, a robust method for handling skewed data.

        The multi-class target variable (num) is converted into a binary target: 0 for no disease and 1 for the presence of disease.

        Categorical text-based columns are converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding.

    Feature Scaling:

        Before applying PCA, all features are standardized using StandardScaler. This is a critical step, as PCA is sensitive to the variance of the features.

    Baseline Model (Without PCA):

        A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the full set of scaled features to establish a baseline performance metric.

    PCA for Dimensionality Reduction:

        Principal Component Analysis is applied to the scaled dataset to reduce its dimensionality.

        The number of components is chosen to retain 90% of the original variance, ensuring most of the informational content is preserved in a smaller set of features.

    Model with PCA:

        A second SVM classifier is trained using only the new, reduced set of principal components generated by PCA.

    Comparison and Evaluation:

        The accuracy and confusion matrices of both models (with and without PCA) are compared side-by-side. This allows for a clear evaluation of PCA's impact on model performance and complexity.

Results and Conclusion üí°

The project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of PCA. The baseline model trained on all features achieved a high accuracy, while the model trained on the reduced set of principal components yielded a nearly identical accuracy.

This result confirms that PCA can significantly reduce the dimensionality and complexity of a dataset (e.g., from 22 features down to 15) with minimal to no loss in the final model's predictive power, leading to a more efficient and potentially more interpretable model.
